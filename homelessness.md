# Homelessness Primer
## What is Homelessness?
At first glance, this may seem to be a pretty straight forward question. But when we are attempting to research homelessness, there is the need to agree on a definition to ensure that we are all measuring the same thing. Some of the things that are considered are:
- Is there a minimum amount of time you need to be homeless?
- Are there types of accommodation where you could be staying in which you would still be counted as homeless?
- How stable does your accommodation need to be in terms of duration for you to be considered not homeless?
- Where does 'at risk' of homelessness factor in?

While there are similarities in definitions of homelessness, they typically vary slightly in these dimensions depending on your location. Definitions can also change over time.

In the case of this work, the dataset is from the US from 2007 to 2017. Their [current definition of homelessness](https://endhomelessness.org/resource/changes-in-the-hud-definition-of-homeless/) (in place since January 2012) is divided into four components:

#### A Note on Language
The language that we use to refer to people often has powerful impacts on how we perceive them. While it can be tempting to use 'short forms' of language, these may act to limit the description of a person to one element of their situation, such as 'the homeless'. For those who work in the homelessness sector, the first thing that we want to acknowledge is that people experiencing homelessness are people first. I also prefer to use the terminology 'experiencing homelessness' as opposed to 'are homeless' as it further helps to reduce the definition of the person by their housing state, and hopefully helps to convey that this is a current situation, but doesn't have to be a permanent situation. While other language may slip in at times, for the most part, it is the preference that any references within this project use similar phraseology.

### US Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Homelessness Definition
The HUD definition of homelessness is used because they are the funders of the accommodation/housing services typically associated with homelessness and also provide the requirements for how homelessness is counted.

#### Core Definition
An individual or family who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence, which includes a primary nighttime residence of:
- Place not designed for or ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation (including car, park, abandoned building, bus/train station, airport, or camping ground)
- Publicly or privately operated shelter or transitional housing, including a hotel or motel paid for by government or charitable organizations;

In addition, a person is considered homeless if he or she is being discharged from an institution where he or she has been a resident for 90
days or less and the person resided in a shelter (but not transitional
housing) or place not meant for human habitation immediately prior to entering that institution.

**Note:** Changes to this definition increased the amount of time that a person could reside in an institution and still be considered homeless (from 30 days to 90 days), but excluded those returning to transitional housing.

#### Imminently Losing Primary Nighttime Residence
Individual or family is being evicted within 14 days from their primary nighttime residence and:
- No subsequent residence has been identified; and
- The household lacks the resources or support networks (i.e. family, friends, faith-based or other social networks) needed to obtain other permanent housing.

**Note:** Changes to this definition increased the time to eviction from 7 days to 14.

#### Persistent Housing Instability
People with ALL of these characteristics:
1. Unaccompanied youth (less than 25 years of age) or family with children and youth;
2. Defined as homeless under other federal statutes (for example the
definition used by the Department of Education) who do not otherwise qualify as homeless under HUD’s definition;
3. Has not had a lease, ownership interest, or occupancy agreement in permanent housing in the 60 days prior to applying for assistance;
4. Has moved two or more times in the 60 days immediately prior to applying for assistance;
5. Has one or more of the following:
    - chronic disabilities,
    - chronic physical or mental
    - health conditions
    - substance addiction
    - histories of domestic violence or childhood abuse
    - child with a disability
    - two or more barriers to employment, which include
        - lack of a high school degree or GED
        - illiteracy
        - low English proficiency
        - history of incarceration or detention for criminal activity
        - history of unstable employment

**Note:** This was a new definition as of 2012.

####  Fleeing Domestic Violence
Any individual or family who:
- Is fleeing, or is attempting to flee, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life-threatening conditions that relate to violence;
- Has no other residence; and
- Lacks the resources or support networks to obtain other permanent housing.

**Note:** No practical changes were made to this definition in 2012.

In each of these cases, information about what documentation can be used to help confirm is also included (though lack of documentation is not to be considered a reason not to include someone within the definition).

#### Impact of Changing Definitions
The changes in the definition highlight that at times, changes in numbers can be due to changes in definitions, in addition to changes as a result of efforts to reduce homelessness and other macro-level factors that may affect numbers.

In the case of these changes, the majority of them would increase the number of people who are included within the definition of homelessness when compared to the previous definition.

### Types of Homelessness
Within the above definitions, different types of homelessness are often classified. Specifically, when put into practice, HUD using the [following classifications](https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/HomelessDefinition_RecordkeepingRequirementsandCriteria.pdf).

#### Literally Homeless
Includes:
- People living in places not meant for human habitation
- People living in shelters or temporary living arrangements
- People exiting an institution where they resided for less than 90 days and lived in a shelter or place not meant for human habitation prior to this

#### Imminent Risk of Homelessness
Includes:
- People who will lose their primary residence with 14 days; and
- They have no subsequent residence identified; and
- They lack resources or support networks to obtain permanent housing

#### Homeless Under Other Federal Statutes
This helps HUD collaborate with other departments who work in homelessness without changing its own definition.

It includes unaccompanied youth and families with children or youth who would not otherwise be included, but who:
- Are defined as homeless under the other listed federal statutes
- Have not had secure, permanent housing in the last 60 days
- Have moved twice or more in the last 60 days
- Are expected to continue in this situation for an extended period of time

#### Fleeing/Attempting to Flee Domestic Violence
(The same as is outlined above)


These functional definitions begin to show some of the categories of homelessness. There are those who are experience **literal (or absolute) homelessness**, those who are **at (imminent) risk of homelessness**, those who may be **housed but with instability (sometimes called 'hidden homeless')**, and those **fleeing domestic violence**.

Other categorizations of homelessness address where people reside and how long they have been homeless.

#### Sheltered
It is recognized that while people experience homelessness they may reside in temporary accommodation. These can be shelters, transitional housing (limited duration of stay allowed), or other temporary accommodation.

It is important to recognize that while people in this accommodation may be less visible, and that being indoors can be more safe than being outdoors, they are still homeless, and access to temporary accommodation is not a final solution to homelessness.

#### Unsheltered
People who are unsheltered while experiencing homelessness are often what might be imagined as a 'typical homeless person'. People in this situation are often at greater health risks from environmental factors such as extreme heat and cold, storms, and other weather events. While moving people indoors is often considered 'more safe' there are those that find increased safety, support or access to resources/structures that they need to survive when they are not indoors.

#### Chronic Homelessness
Chronic homelessness refers to how long someone has been homeless. [HUD published it's rule](https://www.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/Defining-Chronically-Homeless-Final-Rule.pdf) to define chronic homelessness in December 2015.

Here is the exact language for the definitions:

"_A ‘‘chronically homeless’’ individual is defined to mean a homeless individual with a disability who lives either in a place not meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or in an emergency shelter, or in an institutional care facility if the individual has been living in the facility for fewer than 90 days and had been living in a place not
meant for human habitation, a safe haven, or in an emergency shelter
immediately before entering the institutional care facility. In order to
meet the ‘‘chronically homeless’’ definition, the individual also must
have been living as described above continuously for at least 12 months, or
on at least four separate occasions in the last 3 years, where the combined
occasions total a length of time of at least 12 months. Each period separating the occasions must include at least 7 nights of living in a situation other than a place not meant for human habitation, in an emergency shelter, or in a safe haven._"

The key details are:
- An individual who has a disability (includes addictions and mental health)
- Has been literally homeless (as defined above) for at least 12 months; or
- Has been literally homeless for a total over a year within the last three years as a result of as least four separate instances homelessness that have been separated at least 7 days of living in accommodation that would not cause them to be classified as literally homeless.

For families, the language is:

"_Chronically homeless families are families with adult heads of household who meet the definition of a chronically homeless individual. If there is no adult in the family, the family would still be considered chronically homeless if a minor head of household meets all the criteria of a chronically homeless individual. A chronically homeless family includes those whose composition has fluctuated while the head of household has been homeless._"

That is:
- The head of the family needs to meet the criteria for an individual
- The head of the family doesn't have to be a legal adult
- Family composition can change during this time

The requirement of a disability by HUD within this definition, as well as the time duration, means that people who are considered to be chronically homeless have often experienced challenges in accessing homelessness services in the past, and may be considered to be 'difficult to house.' Research has demonstrated that people experiencing chronic homelessness use a disproportionately large amount of homelessness services, and that effectively addressing chronic homelessness can be of economic benefit.

## Who is Homeless?
While individual factors do contribute to experiences of homelessness, homelessness can affect people of varying socio-economic statuses, genders, ethnic backgrounds, and other characteristics.

Because cause and effect directions can often be complicated when discussing homelessness, typically characteristics such as addiction and  mental health are not used to discuss who is homeless. Instead, other demographic categories are used. When counting homelessness, what categories are used can reflect policy priorities.

In HUD definitions, these include (**Need definition link**):
- Individuals (includes unaccompanied youth)
- Families (includes youth-led families and couples)
- Youth (includes children (under 18), and young adults (18 to 24))
- Veterans

While youth are included as a specific age category within HUD categories, one demographic that is not currently included is seniors. Within homelessness, people are typically categorized as seniors early than would be used in the general population because of the impacts of homelessness upon aging. (**Need reference link**) A common age limit is those 50 years and above. When seniors are counted, it is found that they have become the fastest growing demographic of people experiencing homelessness when compared to youth and adults.
