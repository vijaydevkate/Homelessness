# How to Contribute
Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! It is still in its beginning stages and so the process for collaboration will develop over time. All elements of the project are in need of collaboration, from documentation, to identifying and gathering appropriate datasets, data wrangling and exploration, to model development. If you're interested in helping out, there's probably a place for you!

The project is currently being developed using Jupyter Notebooks. Coding in Python or R is preferred.

## First Steps
1. Check out the [README](https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/Homelessness/blob/master/README.md) for an overview of the project
2. Familiarize yourself with the definitions of homelessness and the structure of the [primary dataset](https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/Homelessness/blob/master/datasets/homeless-final.csv)
3. Review [other datasets](https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/Homelessness/tree/master/datasets) gathered for the project
4. Check out the [Issues](https://github.com/rebeccaebarnes/Homelessness/issues) for existing projects that you might be interested in
